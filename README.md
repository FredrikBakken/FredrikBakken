# Fredrik Bakken

Hi, I'm Fredrik ðŸ‘‹ I work as a Big-Data Developer at Telenor Norway, where I'm responsible for the design, development, architecture, implementation, and security of an application that processes 150 million rows of data on a daily basis, and stores up to 100 billion rows of total data with search time at a couple of milliseconds. I'm a huge nerd who loves to challenge myself with new projects and technologies :rocket:
